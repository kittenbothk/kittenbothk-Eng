## FAQ

### 1: There is no reaction after pressing the buttons on the Micro:bit.

路    A: This is because KOI has a longer boot time than Micro:bit. When the power is turned on, Micro:bit has already ran the code for KOI initialization before KOI is ready.

路    Solution: Reset your Micro:bit after KOI has been turned on. (The trick is to let KOI power on completely before initialization.)

### 2: Does KOI work with 3V input?

路    A: No, KOI only works with 5V.

### 3: Why does the text disappear after a short while?

路    A: Since the dislay of the KOI keeps refreshing, the text cannot persist on the screen for a long time. For displaying persisting text, considering connecting an I2C OLED screen.
