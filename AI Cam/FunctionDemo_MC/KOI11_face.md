When the power is turned on, Micro:bit has already ran the code for KOI initialization before KOI is ready.·    Solution: Reset your Micro:bit after KOI has been turned on. (The trick is to let KOI power on completely before initialization.)### 2: Does KOI work with 3V input?·    A: No, KOI only works with 5V.
