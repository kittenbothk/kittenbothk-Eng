### **KOI Close Up**

Let's take a closer look at the AI Camera KOI.

##### **Correct Orientation**

This is the default orientation of KOI.

##### **Camera Rotation**

The camera can be rotated from 0° to 180°. Be careful of the cable when rotating the camera.

##### **Front Camera Mode**

When both the camera and the display are facing towards you, the KOI is set up in Front Camera mode.

This is usually used in face detection or visual recognition.

##### **Back Camera Mode**

Wehn the camera and the display are facing the opposite the direction, the KOI is set up in Back Camera mode.

This is usually used in object classification, qr code/barcode recognition or line tracing.

##### **Display and Coordinates**

KOI uses an IPS display with a resolution of 240x240.

The origin of the coordinates is at the top left corner with (x,y)=(0,0).

Real time camera feed and system notifications will be displayed on the monitor.

##### **A & B** and **Reset** Buttons

2 programmable buttons are found on both sides of the KOI, they function like the A and B buttons found on the Micro:bit.

A reset button is also found on the lower left hand side of the KOI, this is seldomly used.
