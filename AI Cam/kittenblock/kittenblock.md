# KOI Programming with KittenBlock QuickStart

KOI can also be programmed using KittenBlock.

## Connecting the KOI

First, we need to establish connection with the KOI in KittenBlock.

Connect your KOI to the computer using a USB cable.

#### Select KOI from the hardware selector.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Clicking on the blocks has no effect after connecting the KOI.

#### The firmware may be outdated, use the firmware update function to undate the firmware.

### 2. Running the image classifier returns an undefined error.

#### The Classifier hasn't been reset, reset the classifier and try again.

### 3. Can I upload the program to run on the KOI?

#### Yes, the KOI will run the main.py on startup.
