PowerBrick All-In-One is an educational kit set designed by Kittenbot for BBC Micro:bit.

This kit comes with many sensors and actuators, enabling primary and secondary school students to easily learn coding and develop their makerism.

## Background Information

Most schools in Hong Kong use the BBC Micro:bit for STEM education, since the Micro:bit combines various components onto a small convenient package.

However the BBC Micro:bit has shortcomings in terms of its edge connectors, teachers and students find that these connectors are annoying and troublesome to use. Problems such as loose connection and incorrect wiring are frequent, reducing efficiency in teaching and learning.

The exposed circuit boards present another problems where components can be damaged or short-circuited.

Instead of dealing with troublesome wiring, Kittenbot hopes that students can spend more time with coding and computational thinking.

In sight of this, Kittenbot has developed the Powerbrick series, simplifying the connection and including 10 kinds of sensors and actuators, making teaching and learning easier.

This product allows students to quickly realize and implement their creativity in a physical form, thus trains their logical thinking and makerism.

## PowerBrick Features

1. The Armourbit expansion box is designed for BBC Micro:bit and supports programming in MakeCode.
2. Armourbit has a built-in buzzer, servo interface and a motor interface.
3. Armourbit adopts a foolproof connection method, modules can be connected by simply using 1 cable without the worry of an inverted connection.
4. Each module is protected by a hard plastic shell, making the modules safer and more visually appealing.
5. The modules are compatible with building blocks, students can easily design and build different machines and creations.
6. Powerbrick is compatible with other Kittenbot modules such as KOI AI Camera or WifiBrick.
