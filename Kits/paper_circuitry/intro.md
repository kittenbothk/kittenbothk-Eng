# Circuitry Experiments Education Kit

![](images/3.jpg)

In Hong Kong, most STEM education focuses on Senior Primary School or Junior Secondary School pupils, resulting in a lack of STEM education among Junior Primary School pupils. Kittenbot believes that a strong understanding in fundamental STEM knowledge is important, and that STEM education should begin way before coding training begins.

In sight of this, Kittenbot has developed the Circuitry Experiments Education Kit, a STEM education kit designed for junior primary school students. This kit focuses on the basics for electrical circuits, while including topics about sound and light.

The kit includes 12 story-based scenarios and a total of 47 electronic components scattered in 12 lessons. Students will be able to learn the basics of electric circuits and electronic components through vivid and engaging stories as well as hands-on experiments.
