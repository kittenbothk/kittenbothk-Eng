# Learning Python 3 with Kittenblock

A Python editor has been integrated into KittenBlock, while many programming blocks are powered by Python code.

If you wish to learn Python, this Python editor is a good start.

## Using the Python Editor

Read [Python Editor Interface](../kittenbot_function/kittenpython.md) to learn the interface of the editor.

Click the switch in the upper right corner to toggle Python mode.

## Python and Programming Blocks

The programming blocks can be translated into Python code with just one-click of a button. This can be very useful in learning the the indentations, logic or language of Python.

Python code can also be generated by directly dragging the programming blocks into the editor.
