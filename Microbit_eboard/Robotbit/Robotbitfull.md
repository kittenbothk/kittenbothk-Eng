## Robotbit & MakeCode

Robotbit improves the functions of Micro:bit on multiple aspects, Kittenbot has developed an extension for Robotbit so that users can easily make use of these functions.

Please refer to the following document for details:

[Robotbit & MakeCode](./robotbitMC)

## Commonly Asked Questions

### Robotbit does not turn on after installing battery and switching on the power.

Please check if the battery has been activated via the activator button.  
Please check if the battery has been installed correctly.  
Please check if the battery is charged. 

----------

### What is the function of the battery activator?

The battery activator serves as a protection mechanism. In case of accidents such as over current or short circuit, the protection circuit will be activated to cut off the power to prevent damage. Pressing the activator will reset the circuit to its working state.

----------

### I can't find my Micro:bit or Robotbit when connecting it to my computer.

The USB port on the Robotbit is only for charging the battery, not for communicating with a computer.

----------

### Will I destroy the Robotbit if I install the battery in the wrong way?

No, Robotbit was designed to prevent damage in this case. However please still be careful when installing the battery.

----------

### Will I destroy the Robotbit by inserting the Micro:bit in the wrong way?

No because Micro:bit will not be powered in this case.

----------

### How do I use Pin 0?

Pin 0 is used by the buzzer by default, remove the buzzer jumper to use Pin 0 as normal.

----------

### Micro:bit has more than 8 IO pins, where are the other ones on the Micro:bit?


Although Micro:bit has close to 20 IO pins, a lot of them are used by the Micro:bit's built-in devices such as the LED matrix.

Although these occupied pins can in fact be used, it may be confusing and difficult for beginners. The 8 remaining free pins accessible with the Robotbit is more than enough for most projects.
     
If more IO pins are required, consider using IOBit, another expansion board made by Kittenbot.

----------

### Can the Servo Ports be used as IO Ports?

No, because the 8 servo ports are controlled by a servo driver, they are not IO pins.

----------

### What is the use of VM port on the Motor ports?

The VM port is only used by stepper motors, DC motors only need to use A+A- or B+B-è€…B+B-.

----------

### Can the board be placed on a metal or wet surface?

No, doing so will cause a short circuit and damage the board. Please install a Base to prevent short circuit.

[Base Installation](https://youtu.be/FhimDxoAsj4)

----------

### What kind of current is supported by the external power input?

The external input supports a maximum current of 6V3A.

----------

### I can't reproduce the results from the tutorials.

There may be slight mistakes in your wiring or your program, check each carefully.  

### The Robotbit seems to be broken, is there a warranty?

Each Robotbit has been tested to be in working order before they are packaged. Please check if the problem is caused by your program or your wiring, if you are certain that the Robotbit is damaged, please contact the supplier. 

If the board is evaluated to be damaged by not man-made damage, the supplier will offer a replacement for boards that are within 1 year of their purchase according to the receipt.
