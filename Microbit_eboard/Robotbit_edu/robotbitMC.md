### 1. Programming Motors

![](../RBimage/robotbit_motor.png)

For information about DC motors by Kittenbot, please visit: [Kittenbot Actuators](../../motors/index)

#### Sample Program:

Connect 2 DC motors to the M1A and M1B port of the Robotbit Edu.

### 2. Programming Servos

For information about servos by Kittenbot, please visit: [Kittenbot Actuators](../../motors/index)

#### Sample Program:

Connect a servo to the S1 port of Robotbit Edu.

    Connect the orange wire from the servo to the yellow wire of the Robotbit.

### 3. Programming Stepper Motors

For information about DC motors by Kittenbot, please visit: [Kittenbot Actuators](../../motors/index)

    The programming blocks were designed for Kittenbot's 28BY-48-5V stepper motor, using other motors may result in reduced accuracy.

#### Sample Program:

Connect Stepper Motors to the M1 and M2 port of the Robotbit Edu, with the red wire connecting to the VM port.

![](./images/stepper_wire.png)

    Stepper Motors have a rotation range of -360 to 360.

### 4. Programming the built-in LED strip

The programming blocks for the LED strip are found in the Neopixel tab.

    Remember to add a "Show" block to display the effect.(Except show color.)

#### 4.1 Lighting up all lights

![](../RBimage/robotbit_code5.png)

#### 4.2 Customizing color with RGB

    RGB value has a range of 0-255.

![](../RBimage/robotbit_code6.png)

#### 4.3 Customizing color with HSL.

    HSL consists of a hue value with the range 0-360, a sturation and brightness value with the range 0-100.

#### 4.4 Lighting up individual lights

    The lights are labelled 0-3. (As labelled on the Robotbit)

#### 4.5 Adjusting the brightness.

    The brightness level has a range of 0-255.

### 5. Programming the IO Pins

The blocks for the IO pins are found in the Pins tab.

    Pin 0-2 can be used as analog pins while P8, P12~P15 can only be used as digital pins.
    Analog values have a range of 0 to 1023, digital values have a range of 0 to 1.

#### 5.1 Reading values from pins

    Pin 0 is occupied by the buzzer by default, the jumper should be removed when using this pin.

#### 5.2 Writing values to pins

    Pin 0 is occupied by the buzzer by default, the jumper should be removed when using this pin.
