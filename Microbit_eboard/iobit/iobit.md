## Precautions:

1. Do not use high current devices, large servos or motors with this board, as this may result it damaging the Micro:bit.
2. The 5V power supply is able to run multiple small servos as long as the total current is less than 1A.
3. Using Pin 0 requires the buzzer to be switched off or the buzzer may buzz erratically.
4. Since Pin 3 to Pin 11 are used by Micro:bit's LED Matrix, the matrix needs to be turned off or it may light up erratically.
5. Do not connect to a USB power with current exceeding 1A.
