SugarBox is the latest expansion box developed by KittenBot, it is designed for FutureBoard and Micro:bit. Its most special feature is the power source, SugarBox utilizes 2 18650 batteries to provide abundant power and long operating hours.

As the name suggests, SugarBox is designed to work with the Sugar series of sensors via the use of 6 3Pin PH2.0 GPIO ports.

SugarBox is capable of driving 4 DC motors and 4 servos, with the addition of 2 brand new encoded motor ports, SugarBox has huge driving capabilities.

SugarBox has a new power monitoring system, allowing control boards to communicate with the system via I2C to obtain information such as Voltage and Battery Capacity. When using with FutureBoard, sound effects can even be played via the built-in speaker.

SugarBox is fully encased by hard ABS shell, not only does it look appealing, it also provides full and complete protection. Pin holes are found on 5 sides to allow easy integration with use case applications.
