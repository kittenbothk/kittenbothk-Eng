Download the program to MicroL:bit.

1. Press button A on the Micro:bit to take a picture.

2. Press button B on the Micro:bit to display the picture.

## Advanced Program

The above program can only save 1 picture because the file is overwritten when a picture is saved. By making use of numbers, we can create a camera program that stores many photos and show them all.

## FAQ

### 1: There is no reaction after pressing the buttons on the Micro:bit.

路    A: This is because KOI has a longer boot time than Micro:bit. When the power is turned on, Micro:bit has already ran the code for KOI initialization before KOI is ready.

路    Solution: Reset your Micro:bit after KOI has been turned on. (The trick is to let KOI power on completely before initialization.)

### 2: Does KOI work with 3V input?

路    A: No, KOI only works with 5V.

### 3: The picture appears noisy and there are black bars when I view the pictures on my computer.

路    A: This is because KOI's camera is not a phone camera, the quality and resolution is not as good. The black bars are caused by the difference in aspect ratio, since our computer monitors are typically 16:9 and KOI is 1:1, black bars would appear.
