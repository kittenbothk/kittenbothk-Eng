## Precautions

- If the sensor is not in use for a long time, please store in a dry container to prevent oxidation due to moisture.
- A warning line is printed on the module, do not insert the sensor deeper than this line as this may cause damage to the circuitry.

## Connecting the module

Connect the Environment Module to Armourbit with a 4Pin cable first, then connect the sensor to the module with a 3Pin cable.
