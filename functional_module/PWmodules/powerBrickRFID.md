## Specifications

- Voltage: 3V-5V
- Dimensions: 56mm X 56mm X 16mm
- Connector: 4Pin PH2.0
- Sensing Distance: Approximately 3cm

## Precautions

- Do not use the module in an environment with strong magnetic fields.
- Any metal between the reader and the card will cause it to fail to write or read.
- It may take sometime when writing a large amount of data into the RFID Card, please wait until the light goes off.
- Cards like Octopus Cards or ID Cards have encrypted data, the reader can only read the UUID of these cards.
