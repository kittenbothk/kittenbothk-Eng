# FutureBoard Details

![](./images/futureboard_blue.jpg)

As the name suggests, FutureBoard is a main control board designed for STEM education in the future. It has many built-in sensors just like the Micro:bit, but unlike the Micro:bit, FutureBoard features a TFT screen capable of displaying full colors. This allows students to display information in real-time and to unlock even more potential for more interesting coding projects.

As STEM education shifts its focus towards AI and IoT, FutureBoard is equipped to satisfy these requirements.  Based on the ESP32 chipset, FutureBoard is able to connect to the Wifi for IoT projects, catering to the trend for the current STEM Education development. FutureBoard retains the design for the edge connectors from the BBC Micro:bit, allowing for easy expandability and compatibility with existing sensors and modules, bridging the past and the future. 

FutureBoard will be a great companion for STEM education.
