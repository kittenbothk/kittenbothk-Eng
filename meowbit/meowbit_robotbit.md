# Meowbit & Robotbit

Meowbit can be used in conjunction with a Robotbit to achieve even more possibilities.

## Robotbit Precautions:

### 1: The battery must be installed in the right way.

### 2: The screen of the Meowbit must be facing outwards.

## Using Robotbit

### Load Robotbit Extension

### Robotbit Extension: https://github.com/KittenBot/meow-robotbit

### [Loading Extensions](../Makecode/powerBrickMC)

    Loading the extension for Robotbit would automatically load the extension for IO pins.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: How to solve the problem of "Robotbit is not defined" error on Meowbit after uploading the program from Kittenblock?
