# High Speed DC Motor

High Speed DC Motor

![](./images/130motor_1.png)

This is a DC motor compatible with Lego technic parts, the speed is 2 times more than the 9g motor. The output axle is also compatible with Lego technic axles. It is suitable for driving robots that require a high speed for example in racing scenarios.

## Specifications

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V~6V
- Rated Voltage: 4.8V
- Rated Current: 200mA
- Blocked Rotor Current: 1800mA   
- Maximum RPM: 200rpm
- Stopping Torque: 1000g
- Weight: 44g
- Connector: Red and Black Motor Connector

## Special Features:

- Uses an axle connector for output:
    - Connect to axles of different lengths to better suit your needs
    
- Dual outputs:
    - Has outputs axles on both sides

- High speed
    - About 3 times the RPM of the GeekServo 9g Motor

- Carbon Brushed Motor
    - Longer Lifespan and Lower Noise

## Dimensions

### In Lego units:

- Length: 10
- Width: 5
- Height: 3
- Output Axle: Technic Axle

### In mm units:

- Length: 72mm
- Width: 39mm
- Height: 23.8mm
- Output Axle: Technic Axle

## Connection

In this demonstration, Robotbit is used. It is also possible to use an Armourbit.
    
### Robotbit

---

Connect the cable to the motor.

## FAQ

1: The Micro:bit does not react when I click the programming blocks.

Make sure the Micro:bit has been connected to the Kittenblock and then try flashing the firmware.
