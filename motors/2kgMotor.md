# GeekServo 2KG Motors

2KG Motors (HKBD8009A)

![](./images/image--010.png)

This is a motor compatible with Lego technic parts, compared to 9g motors, it has a higher speed. The output axle is a Lego technic axle connector. It is suitable for applications where a high power driver is required.

## Specifications

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V~6V
- Rated Voltage: 4.8V
- Rated Current: 70mA
- Blocked Motor Current: 900mA   
- Slipping Current: 700mA
- Maximum Torque: 1.6kg±0.2kg/cm(4.8V)
- Maximum Speed: 45rpm(3V)
- Weight: 20g
- Connector: Red and Black Motor Connector

## Special Features

![](./images/2kg_1.jpg)

Inherits the special features of the 9g motor while improving torque and speed at the same time.

- Uses an axle connector for output
    - Allows connecting axles of different lengths to better suit your needs
    
- Dual Outputs
    - Output axles are found on both sides

- Larger rotational range
    - Has a full 360° range

- Higher Torque
    - About 3 times the torque of a 9g motor

## Dimensions

### In Lego units:

- Length: 5
- Width: 3
- Height: 3
- Output Axle: Technic Axle

### In mm units:

- Length: 40mm
- Width: 24mm
- Height: 24mm

## Connection

### Armourbit

---

Connect the motor to the motor ports on the Armourbit.

    Reversing the connection would not damage the motor, but the rotational direction will be reversed.
     
### Robotbit

---

Connect the motor to the motor ports on the Robotbit.

## FAQ

1: The Micro:bit does not react when I click the programming blocks.

Make sure the Micro:bit has been connected to the Kittenblock and then try flashing the firmware.
