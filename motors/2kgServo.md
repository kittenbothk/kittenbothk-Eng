# GeekServo 2KG Servo

2KG Servo (HKBD8008A)

![](./images/image--003.png)

This is a servo compatible with Lego technic parts, compared to 9g Servos, it can produce a higher torque. The output axle is a Lego technic axle connector. It is suitable for applications where a precise control is required.

## Specifications

- Operating Voltage: 3.3V~6V
- Rated Voltage: 4.8V
- Rated Current: 70mA
- Blocked Rotor Current: 900mA   
- Slipping Current: 700mA
- Maximum Torque: 1.6kg±0.2kg/cm(4.8V)
- Rotational Speed: 60°/0.14s
- Rotational Range: 0°~360°
- Weight: 20g
- Connector: Orange-Red-Brown Servo Connector

## Special Features

![](./images/2kg_1.jpg)

Inherits the special features of the 9g servo while improving torque and speed at the same time.

- Uses an axle connector for output
    - Allows connecting axles of different lengths to better suit your needs
    
- Dual Outputs
    - Output axles are found on both sides

- Larger rotational range
    - Has a full 360° range

- Higher Torque
    - About 3 times the torque of a 9g servo

## FAQ

1: The Micro:bit does not react when I click the programming blocks.

Make sure the Micro:bit has been connected to the Kittenblock and then try flashing the firmware.
