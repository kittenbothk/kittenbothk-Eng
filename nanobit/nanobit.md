# Nanobit

![](./images/1.jpeg)

Nanobit is a micro control board developed by KittenBot, it has all the functions of the BBC Micro:bit except it doesn't have the LED matrix found on the Micro:bit. Because the LED matrix has been omitted, the pins previously occupied by the matrix can be freely used on the Nanobit.

Despite Nanobit's small size, it has an array of useful sensors including but not limited to programmable buttons, accelerometer and temperature sensor, ensuring the full comprehensive functionality of the Nanobit. Nanobit and Micro:bit's similarity extends to the programming platform, like the Micro:bit, Nanobit can be programmed using the Microsoft MakeCode platform.

Nanobit's form factor is designed to facilitate Makers in designing and building smaller application use cases with full and complete functionality.

## Target Users
